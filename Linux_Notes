SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle
-Requirement
--Plan and Design
---Implementing
----Testing
-----Deploy
------Maintenance
SDLC is of two types, they are
1. Waterfall Model
2. Agile Model

1. Waterfall Model:
Waterfall model is linear model, in this model one phase will work and remaining phases need to wait until completion of the above phase.
- Requirement
-- Planning & Designing
--- Development
---- Testing
----- Deployment
------ Maintenance

2. Agile Model
Agile model is flexible model, in this all phases work together and in this model work can be divided into sprints
Sprint1: -> Planning -> Designing -> Development -> Testing -> Deployment -> Maintenance ->
Sprint2: -> Planning -> Designing -> Development -> Testing -> Deployment -> Maintenance ->
Sprint3: -> Planning -> Designing -> Development -> Testing -> Deployment -> Maintenance ->

Day-2
DevOps: Automating the de;ivery of the Application
 Development + Operations = DevOps
 Continuous Integration
 Continuous Delivery
 Continuous Deployment
- Deployment
- Configuration 
- Logs
- Auto Scaling
 - Horizontal Scaling
 - Vertical Scaling

DevOps Life Cycle
->Plan: Software delivery to Client
-->Code: SCM(Source Code Management) tool, which is used to store the code
	-CVCS(Centralized Version Control System): Subversion  : we cannot make the working copy of code into the local system
	-DVCS(Distributed Version Control System): GitHub  : we can make the working copy of code into the local system
--->Build:
	-Build Tools:-Java: Maven, Ant, Gradle
		     -Python: Pip
		     -Nodejs: Npm
		     -Dart: Flutter
		     -dotnet: Msbuild
---->Test: UT(Unit Testing), IT(Integration Testing), PT(Performance Testing), CT(Compatability Testing)
	-SAST(Static Application Security Testing): SonarQube
	-DAST(Dynamic Application Security Testing: OWASP
----->Release: All the devops stages are integrated here
	-Release tool: Jenkins, Gitops
------>Deploy: we can deploy the application in to Server, like: AWS, Azure, GCP,... through: EKS, EBS, Docker
------->Operate: IAC(Infrastructure As Code): Terraform or Cinfiguration tools: Ansible
-------->Monitor: continuously monitor the application working status with tools like: Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, Splunk...

DevSecOps
 DevOps + Security

Day-3
Linux Installation 
-> open the "Turn Windows feature on or off" from start menu
--> then check the option "Windows Subsystem for Linux" then click ok
---> then Restart the system
----> then open the POwershell as Administrator and run the below command
	: wsl --install -d ubuntu
	-> then create a user and provide the password
	
What is an OS?
->which can control all the storage, input and output devices.
-> every operation in the system can be done by the inbuilt prograns written in OS.
-> which can manage:-Process management
		    -Memory management
		    -File system management
		    -Device management
		    -Security
		    -User Interface
-Popular OS
	-Linux
	-Windows
	-Mac
	-Android
	-iOS
	-Unix
	-Chrome OS
	
In DevOps mostly used OS is Linux.
-Why we use Linux?
	-It is light weight operating system(less storage)
	-It is opensource
	-more secure
	-performance is fast compared other OS
	-we can perform multiple tasks at a time
-Types of OS is Linux
	-RPM(Redhat Package Management): Centos, Fedora, Suse, Amazon  Linux, Redhat and Package management tools are: Yum, dnf
	-Debiam: Ubuntu, Debian, Kali Linux and Package management tools are: apt or apt-get

Day-4	
Linux Directory Structure
-bin: All Linux commands work because of bin directory
-dev: Storage
-home: when you install a Linux OS, by default we have two users
	1. one is 'root user': who has the full access like read, write and execute
	2. another one is 'normal user': who has limited access
	-> Root user can add number of noraml users by using the commmand "adduser username" or "useradd username"
	-> when we create an user, a default directory with user name will create to that user in home directory
-mnt(mount): Storage
-tmp: the directory where everyone has full access
-var: varying: which can contain the log files which are varying frequently
-boot: which contains the booting process program files
	BIOS(Basic Input Output System), MBR(Master Boot Record), GRUB, Kernel, Init, Runlevel Programs
-etc: which will save the configuration files
	if we create users, then that configuration files will be saved in the 'etc' directory, we can find them by using the command "cat /etc/shadow
-media: which can used to store the audio and video data
-opt: third party applications(jenkins master slave)
-root: home directory for root user is "/root"
	for normal user they have own directory with the user name in the "home" directory

Day-5	
Linux Commands
	-File management commands
	-File permission commands
	-User management commands
	-Process management commands
	-Storage management commands
	-Network management commands
	-Package management commands
-File Management Commands:
	In Linux we can create different types of empty files using the "touch" command
	->syntex: touch filename.filetype
	->example: touch file1.txt
	In Linux we can create different type files at a time
	-> exapmle: touch file1.txt file2.ppt file3.doc file4.abc
	In Linux we can delete the file using "rm" command
	->syntex: rm filename
	->example: rm file1.txt

	->synetx: rm *
	for deleting files which are started with same file name, we can use below command
	->syntex: rm file starting name*
	->example: rm file* (for removing files starting with name file)
	for deleting files which are ending with same file name, we can use below command
	->syntex: rm *file ending name
	->example: rm *file (for removing files ending with name file)
	for deleting files which contain same file name in the middle, we can use below command
	->syntex: rm *file common name*
	->example: rm *file* (for removing files contain same name file in middle)
	for deleting all files/directories forcefully we use the below command
	->synetx: rm -rf filename/directoryname
	->example: rm -rf file1/dir1
	To check the current working directory, we can use the below command
	->syntex: pwd
	In Linux we can create the directory by using the below command
	->syntex: mkdir directoryname
	->exapmle: mkdir dir1
	To see the created files or directories, we can use the below command
	->syntex: ls
	To see the created files or directories with details, we can use the below command
	->syntex: ls -l

	Document editors in Linux are:
	->vi editor
	->nano editor
	vi editor: It is used to insert the data into files
	To open the file, we can use 'vi filename' command
	->syntex: vi filename
	->example: vi file1
	It will open the file, then for inserting the data we use the command 'i' or 'insert'
	-> syntex: i or insert
	for replacing the entered data, again use the 'i' or 'insert' command, then we can enter our required data where we need to replace
	after entering the data into the file, for exit from the insert mode we use 'esc' button
	For deleting a line, we can use the 'esc+dd' command
	->syntex: esc+dd
	To delete number of lines, we can use 'number of lines+dd'
	->syntex: number of lines+dd
	->example: 2+dd (for deleting 2 lines)

	To see the data from the file in reverse order, we can use 'tac' command
	->syntex: tac filename
	->example: tac file2
	
Day-6
	Copy
	Move
	Grep
	Copy: which can duplicate the exisitng file, In Linux we have three types of file copying
	1.File to File copying: in this we can create a new file and copy the data from the existing file
	->syntex: cp source_filename target_filename
	->example: cp file1 file2
	To copy the data from multiple files to newfile
	->syntex: cat filename filename >newfilename

	for copying specific files from one direct to another directory
	->syntex: cp -r source_directory_name/{filename,filename,filename} target_directory_name
	->example: cp -r dir1/{file1,file2,file3} dir2
	Head
	Tail

	Grep: which is used to search specific text patterns in the file
	To print the data conatins the text with case that we requested
	->syntex: grep "text_to_be_search" filename
	->example: grep "surya" file3
	To print the exact data we requested with case, to show the data that matches the pattern
	->syntex: grep -o ""text_to_be_search" filename

	Sed:It is used to print and delete data from the file, in this we two components
	n for printing
	i for deleting, substituting
	To print n number of lines from a file
	->syntex: sed -n 'starting_position,ending_position+p' filename
	->example: sed -n '1,5p' file1
	To print data from specific line to specific line
	->syntex: sed -n 'starting_position,ending_position+p' filename

Day-9
	User Management
	While installing Linux OS, we have two users one is Root user and second is Normal user
	Root user: who has full access like: read, write and execute
	Normal user: who has limited access, sometimes normal user can take the root user priviliges using 'sudo' command
	->example: Root user can install the application using: apt install git,
			   while normal user can install the applicaation using: sudo apt install git, when he is in sudo group.
	We can find the user list in the shadow file which is present in the /etc directory
	->syntex: cat /etc/shadow
	To check an user is exist or not, we have two commands
	->syntex: id username or cat /etc/shadow | grep "username"
	->example: id user1 or cat /etc/shadow | grep "user1"
	For adding user we have two methods, they are: 'useradd' and 'adduser'
	1.useradd: with this method we cannot set the password to the user,

	->example: useradd user1
	After creating user we need to set password seperatly by using 'passwd' command
	->syntex: passwd username
	->example: passwd user1
	2.adduser: in this method we can set password while creating the user
	->syntex: adduser username
	->example: adduser user1
	While creating a noraml user with adduser, then a directory will be created in the /home directory with the same user name
	To see the details of specific directory, we use 'ls -ld' command
	->syntex: ls -ld directory_name
	->example: ls -ld dir1
	When you create a file/directory they conatins two types of owners, they are
	1.userowner
	2.groupowner
	When you check an user, using 'id' command we will get below details
	->syntex: id username
	->example: id user1
	we will get: uid=1003(user1) gid=1003(user1) groups=1003(user1),100(users),1002(grp1)
	in this uid=1003(user1) is the user id of the user
	gid=1003(user1) is the primary or default group of user
	groups=1003(user1) is the secondary group of user
	One user can have only one primery group and he can be added to multiple secondary groups
	We can create the group using the 'groupadd' command

	To delete the user from the group, we can use
	->syntex: gpasswd -d user_name group_name
	->example: gpasswd -d user1 group1
	To delete the user we use 'userdel' command, but hear we cannot delete the directory of the user
	->syntex: userdel username
	->example: userdel user1
	To delete the user and user directory, we use 'userdel -r' command
	->syntex: userdel -r username
	->example: userdel -r user1

	->syntex: chage -M number_of_days user_name
	->example: chage -M 30 user1
	To set warning for the user password, we use 'chage' command
	->syntex: chage -W number_of_days user_name
	->example: chage -W 30 user1
